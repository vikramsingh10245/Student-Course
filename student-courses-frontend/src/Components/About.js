        <span>
        I've built a comprehensive student course management system using React.js, HTML, CSS, 
        and Bootstrap for the frontend. The backend is powered by Spring Boot, with MySQL as 
        the database management system. This project seamlessly integrates frontend and backend 
        technologies, allowing for efficient course management operations like adding, updating,
         and deleting courses. Leveraging the power of React libraries and Spring Boot's robust 
         framework, I've created a scalable and responsive application that streamlines the course management process
